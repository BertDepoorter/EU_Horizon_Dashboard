The consortium has developed the first diagnostic test that addresses this problem. PvSeroRDT aims to develop a point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to transfer the consortium’s validated lab-based test to the field to support implementation of the P. vivax Serological Test and Treatment (PvSeroTAT) malaria control strategy.      The PvSeroRDT specific objectives are: 1) Develop a POC RDT using lateral flow technology to measure antibodies to four P. vivax proteins that are biomarkers for the dormant liver-stage of P. vivax. 2) Establish Africa-based manufacturing capacity at DIATROPIX (Senegal) following RDT development at Abingdon Health, a UK-based SME specialising in lateral flow assays.3) Validate RDT performance with bio-banked samples, followed by field-based clinical validation on freshly collected samples in Ethiopia and Madagascar.4) Develop a clear regulatory strategy to streamline market authorization and access to this first-in-class P. vivax serological testing. PvSeroRDT addresses all expected outcomes and impacts of this call topic and work program, respectively. Specifically, it will contribute a robust POC diagnostic to the pipeline in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and enable the implementation of the AU-EU Innovation Agenda for public health. The project is designed to address the WHO’s preferred profile for P. vivax diagnosis, to translate an SME prototype to Africa-based industrial design, and to test clinical performance in several SSA sites, thus enhancing international cooperation in SSA and improving training opportunities in SSA. Ultimately, PvSeroRDT will facilitate implementation of PvSeroTAT – a new intervention for malaria elimination.\"",

The partnership will implement a range of activities via peer-to-peer learning, including study visits and staff exchanges, to develop closer relationships within the partnership, and with the wider regional innovation ecosystems, as well as to learn improved innovation support measures.  These will be cemented via operational work to build and develop innovation ecosystems and SMEs via hackathons and challenges (160 organisations involved),  by providing direct SME support on innovation management (24 cross-border KAM cases), and helping widening country SMEs towards financing of innovation projects (50+ cases). Over 450 SMEs will be engaged with during the implementation of the project, which will include active cooperation with 20 other innovation ecosystems. BIOBoost connects 7 homogenous EU regions in terms of similarities of RIS3 and S3 Platform synergies related to bioeconomy and digitalisation. The multidisciplinary partnership has been strategically selected, to work in  an inclusive and interactive bottom-up process, to discover potential new activities, and identify new opportunities that emerge from this interaction. Despite the homogeneity in terms of regional smart specialisation, the consortium consists of partners with a wide variety of complementary skills and experience, covering a wide geographical area and with considerable economic, social and environmental differences.\"",

         "\"Chronic inflammation underlies several diseases. In Crohns disease (CD), there is mounting evidence of a preclinical phase characterized by immunological changes that precede symptoms. Here, we propose a thorough and innovative approach to better understand the health-to-chronic inflammation transition occurring in patients with CD that will be translated in improved disease prediction and prevention. We will address how changes in glycosylation of the gut mucosa act as a primary event that dysregulates not only local mechanisms (imposing maladapted host-microbiome interactions) but also systemic mechanisms (promoting anti-microbial antibodies production), involving the novel concept of glycan mimicry as an early trigger of the health to inflammation transition  GlycanTrigger. Capitalizing on our recent findings showing that changes in the expression of complex branched N-glycans at gut mucosa regulate Inflammatory Bowel Disease immunopathogenesis, we here hypothesize that changes in gut glycocalyx impose early perturbations in host-microbiome interactions, leading to the exposure of altered (glyco)neoantigens, both by pathogens and host epithelial cells which trigger the activation of innate immune response. Moreover, following our recent discovery that changes in glycosylation can be detected in serum years before CD diagnosis and are correlated with increased levels of pathogenic antimicrobial antibodies (ASCA), we will here pursue the hypothesis that changes in mucosa glycans constitute a major source for the development of anti-glycan antibodies (ASCA), associated with health-to-inflammation transition. The long-term GOAL of this proposal is to unlock, through an integrative approach, a new checkpoint that regulates the transition to chronic inflammation. Our proposal will lead to breakthrough concepts in the health to chronic inflammation transition and to novel predictive tools translated in novel glyco-intervention strategies for disease prevention.\"",

As part of the FPA, a call for proposals (CfP) was launched jointly with the EU and supported the preclinical development of Rift Valley Fever Virus vaccines and the late-stage development of Chikungunya virus vaccines (CHIKV). While previous funding has led to the development of pre-licensure CHIK vaccines, in this current application we like to further advance our CHIK vaccine programme, and support CHIK vaccines that are near or have achieved regulatory licensure by supporting their clinical development into phase IV clinical trials to increase our understanding of the long-term safety, durability of protection, and effectiveness against virologically confirmed disease. Furthermore, we would like to expand the use indication by supporting clinical trials in vulnerable populations, including children, immunosuppressed and pregnant women. As part of this grant application, we also like to launch a CfP on Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIM). The overall objective of the CHIM proposal is to support research projects that increase knowledge in vaccine-induced mucosal immunity and advance the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against coronaviruses and other potential respiratory viral threats. The expected outcome of this CfP is to create a global network of experts conducting CHIM at a high level of consistency and reliability. This current grant application seeks to leverage €70M from Horizon Europe, which will be supplemented with €30M from CEPI making a pool of €100M. Awards will have a 36–48-month duration and will be administered by the CEPI secretariat.\"",

The founding team coThe Oater is a female-founded food tech start-up from Germany that develops a compact machine for hyper-local fresh oat milk production to reduce waste and emissions. The founding team consists of four members, led by CEO and Head of Hardware Sarah Nesti. With Lisa Nesti (CMO) and Henrik Burger (CFO) in the business team and Benjamin Auer (CTO) as the process engineer this diverse team is perfectly equipped to create a successful business. The founders gained prior start-up experience in a B2B e-commerce business launched in 2020 with over 30 customers and 30K Euro revenue. The entire team consists of 9 members, including two marketing experts, two business assistants and a product designer.The Oaters goal is to inspires sustainable consumption to protect and enrich life for all generations to come. We want to achieve this by downsizing the industrial production into a compact machine for local production of fresh oat milk. This doesn’t only improve taste, but also lowers costs and reduces the environmental impact. By producing the oat milk at the point of sale packaging is eliminated and transport emissions are significantly reduced due to the fact that oat milk is 90% water. The Oater’s business model is “Oat milk as a service” meaning that B2B customers borrow the machine for free and only pay by liter for the Oater packages, which consist of the ingredients needed to produce the oat milk in the machine. This model ensures constant delivery profits and scale-up as hardware profits are negligible compared to delivery service. The Oater provides a holistic ecosystem solution, consisting of the IoT machine, frequent replenishments, and a smart online platform. The main objectives are to introduce customers into our ecosystem, simplify entry and make oat milk exciting at the POS.\"",

         "\"Better diagnostic approaches are required to improve TB control in Africa, which is suboptimal. One neglected aspect of TB diagnosis is that of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), which comprises ~15% of the TB caseload. However, in HIV-endemic settings over one third of cases are due to EPTB (the most common manifestation being pleural TB). Frontline same day sputum-based diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert perform poorly when using fluid derived from EPTB-specific compartments (e.g. pleural fluid). Indeed, GeneXpert sensitivity in pleural TB is ~35%. ADA, the current standard of care used in clinical practice has poor specificity, especially in pericardial TB and TB-meningitis (see preliminary data). By contrast, unstimulated interferon-gamma (not T-cell-based IGRAs that require overnight stimulation) is an excellent biomarker for the diagnosis of EPTB (confirmed in 2 meta-analyses). A South African university start-up has now developed a low-cost same-day EPTB diagnostic test (IRISA-TB), which has been evaluated and published in several small clinical trials (see main proposal) and is locked-in for scale-up dissemination in 2022. The test is CE marked, SAHPRA approved,  and endorsed by the Global Fund. This proposal encompasses a large prospective multicentric study (n= 2170 patients) of IRISA-TB in various forms of EPTB (pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal TB, and TB meningitis). The proposed study (EPiTB) has excellent fidelity with the EDCTP call because it will enable “the registration of a new health technology through pragmatic effectiveness studies”, “enable uptake of results into clinical practice” and facilitate WHO endorsement. Thus, EPiTB will drive the facilitation and uptake of an important new TB diagnostic test in Africa. Importantly, an African-invented and designed test will be promoted. Indeed, innovation and the development of an African knowledge-based economy is a key priority of the EDCTP.\"",

         "\"The number of studies and experiments on humans is increasing in Africa. For the past two decades, the setting up of national health research ethics committees (NREC) in Africa, encouraged by the WHO, UNESCO and CIOMS, has resulted to a need for a framework to guide and standardise how Phase II to IV clinical trials in Africa are conducted. Additionally, NREC and National Regulatory Agency (NMRA) must proactively play their roles in managing and regulating clinical trials. In Côte d'Ivoire, an important decree signed by the President of the Republic in April 2020 defines the regulation of clinical trials in the country. The decree positions Universities and the establishment of institutional research ethics committees (IRECs) as the third pillar for enhancing the conduct of clinical trials and other categories of health research. However, only a couple of institutional review committees exist, with a very small proportion of researchers being aware of these IRECs. Furthermore, knowledge about the existence and functions of NRA is estimated to be much lower comparative to NREC. The need for NREC, NMRA and IRECs to work in synergy is a critical prerequisite for raising the quality of clinical trials to international standards.Funded by EDCTP II, the CECABI project (CSA2020ERC-3081), was instrumental in laying the foundation for building the regulatory and ethics capacity in Côte d'Ivoire. Important, it identified critical gaps that need urgent attention. The proposed CECABI II is a three years project that seeks to 1) Build capacity in clinical trials, GCP and research ethics for research practitioners  2) Enhance quality assurance through ISO certification of the NREC3) Digitalise the operations and ongoing collaboration between the NREC and NRA 4) Support the domestication and digitalisation of AVAREF system5)  Monitor and evaluation to implementation of the project\"",

FOWC is a kind of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) system that captures energy of waves and converts it into electricity. The generated electricity is used to produce green Hydrogen from the sea water. The produced Hydrogen is stored inside the internal tanks of the device to be used as the “clean fuel” by the next generation of ships. The idea of this system is the outcome of more than a decade of R&D activities carried out in a prestigious European University to make the WEC devices an economically viable solution to produce clean energy. This innovative solution is the “first and only” WEC in the market that can act like a “floating fuel station” for ocean going ships to reliably produce their clean fuel demand in the middle of oceans with affordable cost. Hence, this technology could play a prominent role in the supply chain of the decarbonizing marine transportation sector that destructively produces 3% carbon emissions in the World. At the moment, this technology has the maturation level of TRL 3. It is planned to perform a further optimization process on the conceptual design of this technology under the scope of this project proposal which allows concluding TRL 3 stage of development. Complementary laboratory tests will be carried out on the optimized model and the new Intellectual property (IP) will be submitted concerning the optimized design. The other main objective of this project proposal is to enhance coordination and marketing skills as well as extending the network of the CEO & Co-Founder of the company and her team according to the unique environment, coaching programme and tailored training session opportunities provided for European Women leaders under the scope of Women TechEU Programme.\"",

It connects English learning to their daily activities, e.g. writing an email at work, watching videos on YouTube, or reading an article for a biology class. Because learning that is personalised and in context has been found to be the most effective form of learning. Elia started as a PhD project. Hence it's based on insights from cognitive linguistics and developed using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. We presented it at conferences in Berkeley and Cambridge. The first demo version of Elia was launched at German universities in January 2022. Currently it has over 1600 users. We are about to close partnerships with two private language school and two student organisations: ISIC France and Spain. Since January, we have been working on improving the product to reach product-market fit. We reduced the churn rate (install to uninstall) from 19%  to 4% and increased the conversion rate (website to install) from 11% to 24%. Currently, 34% of users would be very disappointed if they could no longer use Elia. We are on our way to achieving product-market fit.We need the support of this grant, both financial and mentoring, to help us 1) reach the product-market-fit, 2) help us extend our partnerships and user base, 3) buy us time to find a venture capital investor.

Despite therapeutic advances, VVC remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society and being the second largest gynaecological infection. If it is left untreated, many complications have been appointed as its consequence, such as infertility, subsequent preterm delivery, suppression of the immune system, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic abscess, menstrual disorders and miscarriage.Avodes has developed an innovative medical device for menstruation - a patented anatomically shaped “moist sponge” made of completely natural, biodegradable materials (biodegradable within 1 month). It protects innate defence mechanisms of vaginal microflora during most vulnerable period – menstruation. Studies have shown, that fluctuating hormones and the resulting imbalance of vaginal flora cause an increased risk of a yeast infection every month. Unique Avodes biotechnological solution preserves women’s natural vaginal microbiota in the same time selectively inhibiting growth of pathogenic microorganisms. It reduces risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) by 85 % thus effectively preventing the disease. Avodes is the only medical product designed to prevent infection, rather than deal with the consequences. Avodes effectively disrupts the vicious cycle of ”microbiota disbalance –> infection –> antibiotic/fungicidal treatment–> microbiota disbalance” and offers break-through solution which protects women’s health and the environment.  Women Tech EU programme would support company in upgrading the business model, business and marketing plan, market validation and would help to find partners (clinical, manufacturing and commercial) as well as to prepare funding strategy.

         "\"\"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by the pathological process in which fat, cholesterol and calcium accumulate on the arterial wall. It is the leading cause of mortality in the world, affecting in 2019 about 200 million individuals or 2.5% of the global population and resulting in over 9 million deaths annually. The prevalence of CAD in the European Union (EU) reached 5.11% in 2019 . As a result, CAD-related deaths topped 973,000 in the EU in 2019. CAD incidence is expected to rise further due to the increased prevalence of risk factors including obesity, diabetes, and increasing age. For a patient with CAD, the care pathway still involves enormous variability and complexities. Inefficiencies and challenges in the treatment pathway are associated with poorer patient outcomes including recurrent cardiac events, incomplete revascularization in complex patients, and increased risk of mortality in patients with both acute and chronic CAD. Due to the low sensitivity or specificity of the standard diagnostic tests, 60% of CAD patients unnecessarily undergo an ICA, as they are found to have non-significant coronary stenoses and do not require revascularization.Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) uses X-ray technology and computer processing to create a detailed 3D image of the coronary arteries, revealing the degree of lumen obstruction. It provides non-invasive access to the coronary anatomy, also for asymptomatic patients who would normally not undergo invasive coronary angiography (ICA).  Current guidelines adopted in the US, EU, and the UK recommend CCTA as a first-line test for evaluation of CAD, positioning it as a \"\"gatekeeper\"\" to the Cath lab.In COMBINE-CT, we will deliver a fully automated, vendor agnostic CCTA-enabled workflow for chronic CAD patients, covering diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. COMBINE-CT will close the gaps in the existing workflow for the treatment of chronic CAD, to improve hospital efficiency and patient outcomes. AI-powered CCTA algorithms will enable definitive ischemia diagnosis, accurate patient stratification and efficient planning of the interventions, as well as patient specific follow-up. While our focus on CAD is justified by the large patient population, the CCTA-enabled diagnostic accuracy and seamless workflow, backed by the clinical evidence generated in five multicentre clinical trials, will be directly transferable to other clinical domains using CT.Interdisciplinarity is intrinsically built in the design of the COMBINE-CT consortium, combining expertise in cardiology, cardiovascular radiology, interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, pharmacology – with expertise from engineering (medical imaging) and AI. The public-private partnership in COMBINE-CT integrates top knowledge on several medical disciplines (cardiology, radiology, interventional cardiology) with engineering, AI, design expertise - as well as the involvement of health economists and patient organizations, to fill in the gaps of the current CAD clinical pathways and prepare the ground for the imminent high-volume CCTA needs, beyond the research hospital setting.Clinical partners represent more than half of the COMBINE-CT consortium, ensuring access to large cohorts for stable CAD patients. COMBINE-CT will also lay the ground for further research that is likely to trigger a paradigm shift towards the use of imaging markers in the medical treatment evaluation and clinical trial design.\"\"",

         "\"Macro-economic models are widely applied across the EU to support strategic planning for R&I and the green transition. However, these models do not include a detailed representation of R&I policies and do not explicitly model green technologies and the economic sectors that develop these technologies, the performance of R&D and its role in creating first mover advantages, monopoly rents, and eventually successful deployment of the green and digital technologies. To respond to these challenges, TWINRD aims to develop new data, technology matrices, models and enhance leading existing macro-economic modelling (GEM-E3 and NEMESIS). To this end TWINRD will develop innovative and interdisciplinary approaches for the enhanced modelling representation of R&I and innovation policy in EU-27 and improve the integration of R&I activities in applied macro-economic models based also on the collection, empirical analysis and integration of new data and technology matrices for green and digital technologies into the macro-models. TWINRD will develop a new innovative, open-source model specifically designed to address the Twin transition that goes beyond the standard approaches and will be both supply and demand driven. The advanced modelling tools will be used for the evaluation and assessment of R&I policy impacts on socio-economic and environmental indicators aiming to distil policy-relevant insights. All datasets, models and sets of software will be made freely accessible to stakeholders and the public in the TWINRD online platform and in other channels. The entire project will be based on active stakeholder interactions and inclusive dialogue to co-design the research and scenarios explored based on the creation of TWINRD open forum.\"",

The symptoms can be severe, causing intense pain and suffering for patients. The cost of RA alone for Europe is €45.3 billion p.a.A growing need: Unlike diabetes patients for example who can measure their own blood sugar levels, there is currently no method to measure disease activity quickly and accurately for autoimmune patients, non-invasively at home. Furthermore, most autoimmune diseases have unpredictable flares in disease activity despite stable medication, and the causes of such flares differ between patients and are largely unidentifiable.Our deep-tech innovation is an Artificial Intelligence approach to the Monitoring of Autoimmune Diseases at Home with a Novel Biomarker Algorithm:  Through 15 years of research in this field, the founder of Kaass Discovery, Dr Anita Kaass, has shown a key biomarker, Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), is common to several autoimmune diseases. It has been scientifically shown that GnRH levels increase with increasing disease activity. Kaass Discovery is developing a highly novel, deep tech solution to allow autoimmune disease patients to self-manage their conditions and minimize or even eliminate the symptoms of autoimmune diseases. The solution, which we call ‘a-Doc’, uses a saliva sample to indicate disease activity and provide an accurate, instantaneous value. In line with this need, it is also low cost, accurate and simple to use ensuring it is suitable for home use. The data collected from the device will be sent to the Kaass Discovery Cloud for improving the predictive analytical models, and giving an individualised meaningful result to the user on their mobile deviceThe aims of the Women TechEU programme align perfectly with the needs of Kaass Discovery.  The business coaching support provided will ensure we are prepared and able to successfully commercialise this exciting technology.\"",

The industrial conversion of CO2 into value-added products will cause a slow but steady switch from fossil fuels, turning CO2 from our worst enemy to our best friend. Within the frames of this project, RedoxNRG will develop new electrosorbent materials for the direct air electrocapture of CO2.

The general objectives of the proposed work are: support for the commercialisation of long-term research by prof. Zofia Stępniewska over methanotrophic bacteria, validation of technology and business model, company organisation and preparation of its financing path. Certain cultures of methanotrophic bacteria were examined as part of research conducted at the Department of Biochemistry and Environmental Chemistry of the Catholic University of Lublin. They can absorb methane produced, among others, in coal, lignite, copper and other minerals mines, in the transport of natural gas, as well as in animal husbandry, in landfills, in industrial processes and elsewhere. This will reduce the risks associated with the explosion of methane and reduce its emissions to the atmosphere, and therefore lower the climatic load, because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greenhouse coefficient approximately 25 times higher than CO2 in 25 years. The project is thus consistent with the EU Methane Strategy, which envisages a series of measures to reduce methane emissions. The use of biofilters based on methanotrophic bacteria would reduce the negative impact of methane emissions to the environment, and would also allow to obtain valuable raw materials obtained from the produced bacterial biomass, e.g. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) - a biodegradable plastic, ectoine or carbohydrates for the production of animal feed.The essence of the product is the proper selection of BM bacteria cultures and determination of the optimal environment and parameters of their life. It was the subject of many scientific works conducted by the founder, Microbic Sp. z o.o. - prof. Zofia Stępniewska - during the last 20 years. These bacteria are ready for multiplication and colonisation of biofilters.\"",

I founded Cogo back in March 2020 during the pandemic, with two old colleagues from the management group of momondo, later KAYAK part of Booking Holdings. We founded Cogo with a mission to move people away from short private car trips and on to shared mobility, to help create more sustainable cities. My driver for starting Cogo is that traffic in our cities and the derived CO2 emissions are one of the biggest challenges we need to solve in our lifetime. The industry of shared mobility has come to a stage where the complexity and fragmentation is ready for an aggregator level to reach the full potential shared mobility can offer. To create a successful aggregator that has the perfect combination of best user content, product users love and the right business model is my niche expertise. During this programme we launch and roll-out Cogo full-service platform where users can start, stop, pay and manage all trips across multiple shared mobility operators within the Cogo app. Cogo is currently pre-revenue and will with the launch of the full-service platform start to generate revenue. This project will set-up and execute on a clear strategic and technical roll-out playbook from launch in our home market to roll-out throughout Europe. We will set-up and establish the technical platform to scale quickly yet controlled with Cogo Console for multi-partner operational control including a well-thought through complex revenue management system and strategy to maximise shared mobility utilisation while building a solid revenue foundation.

Knowing the most vulnerable point and its dynamic evolution (where the impact will be worst) is a key information to generate an adaptative answer to climate extreme events and minimize socio economic damages.However, current impact analysis methods are semi-automated, limiting the speed, coverage and number of analyses that can be done. Our solution, interoperable, fast to deploy and easy to use, is based in the analysis of different data sources such as Copernicus (Satellite data), Meteo patterns and OpenData.MARKET OPPORTUNITY. During the last decade thousands of satellites have been put in orbit creating the new space economy. The total amount of investment done just in Copernicus Satellites amounts to 8,2 Billion. In addition, according to Space Capital  the total equity investment over the last decade in the space economy was €177.7 billion. However, the penetration over different industrial markets is very low , putting at risk the Return of Investment (ROI).EARTHPULSE GOAL. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the transformational technique of our era. Satellite data, and in particular, Earth Observation (EO), will greatly benefit, as other areas, from its application by lowering the cost of adoption and accelerating market uptake. Our company goal is to accelerate the market uptake of EO data with AI.At EarthPulse we are working hard on overcoming these barriers with the objective to leverage the full potential of AI4EO to make satellite analytics accessible to anyone (experts and non-expert users) through our Software SPAI.\"",

         "\"Speech and language development is one of the most critical developmental phases in early childhood. Children with poor vocabulary skills at age 5 were four times more likely to have reading difficulties, three times as likely to have mental health problems, and twice as likely to be unemployed when they reached adulthood. Yet it’s one of the most overlooked industries in terms of innovation, the way speech and language development is managed by parents, teachers and healthcare providers has not changed in DECADES.There is an over-reliance on the clinical speech and language therapists as the only means to get an assessment of a child’s speech and language skills. The result of this is children sitting on waiting lists or having early signs of delays missed, all resulting in missing out on reaching critical speech and language developmental milestones.We are developing SHARE, a radical, data driven and digitally-delivered solution to address the problems in understanding children’s speech and language development. Delivering accurate, in-home assessment of speech skills is the key to disrupting this industry, empowering the other stakeholders in this story to understand when a child’s speech skills are on track and when they are not. Our goal is to reduce the over reliance on costly face to face therapy by developing solutions that don’t just replicate existing practice but are developed around data and evidence and reflect the abilities and lifestyles of families. This is a relatively new market segment that crosses several markets and stakeholders across Speech therapy, Digital Health and the emerging New Mom Economy. We will use Women TechEU support to liaise with these stakeholders, develop commercial relations with them and build a regulatory compliance strategy for SHARE. All of these will be leveraged to get contact with and secure the investment needed to complete SHARE development and bring it to the market.\"",

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the 2nd most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world, with profound economic and social impacts. The absence of preventive therapies to tackle PD, requires the development of new therapeutic strategies. For Pharma companies, aiming to develop molecules for Parkinson Disease (PD) and other neurologic disorders, Fastprinciple is developing a new drug candidate, to be used as a future therapy to slow-down PD progression. Unlike alternative solutions (such as the ones commercialized by Bial, Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Abbvie, Lilly, and others), which target the symptoms, we expect to slow down the disease progression, increasing current therapies’ effectiveness overtime. PD affects more than 10 million people globally and has an enormous social and economic burden.  Current treatments manage the symptoms of the disease but do not offer the patients the possibility of a cure. Unfortunately, as the disease progress to higher debilitating stage, the patient stops responding to the current symptomatic therapies, ending without therapeutic options. We have identified a molecule that with the company’s patented reformulation technology will improve the drug efficacy and slowdown the disease progression of the disease.

The innovative and unique technology developed tackles one the current major challenges in healthcare, the rapidly increasing burden of brain diseases. With the increase of life expectancy and aging population neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The greatest unmet needs are better, faster and more cost-effective diagnostic and monitoring tools that could be widely available and have the potential to detect these diseases at the earliest stage in order to delay disability and provide each patient with a personalized treatment.To address this the team of Nocturne identified two major opportunities, the use of the retina as a window to the brain, and an already established on the market hardware imaging technology, cost-effective, widely available with no burden for the patient that can capture retinal images in less than 5 minutes.With its product, Nocturne addresses customers in pharmaceutical research, academia, and clinical care. In Germany alone, more than 1 million patients suffer from relevant diseases like Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and others. We estimate the annual market volume in Germany alone at 350 million€, in Europe at 2 billion€. At market entry, Nocturne product is a CE-certified local installable web service, which accepts data from standard retinal imaging devices. The data are then analyzed with Nocturne’s technology, and a report is generated for the physician. The pricing is based on a pay-per-analysis, a model commonly used, for example, in radiology.Our focus is by removing the technical barriers and by providing unique insights into the diseases to enable better disease management and patient care.\"",

We want to bring our new solution, Drug Hunter, to the drug testing market. Drug Hunter is a portable drug analyzer that measures quantities of illegal drugs in oral fluid, even in multidrug use cases. It can be used onsite by law enforcement agencies, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and workplaces. Our core technologies are capillary electrophoresis, widely recognized as a golden standard for DNA analysis, and ultrasensitive deep UV fluorescence, facilitated by AI-based expert systems. Therefore, Drug Hunter provides lab-grade accuracy for simultaneous identification and quantification of illegal drugs in oral fluid, indicating the recent drug use as well as the severity of possible drug intoxication. There are currently no reliable drug testing solutions on the market (only mainstream immunoassay tests) for onsite use, and none of them can measure the quantities of drugs in the sample. So far, the strength of drug intoxication can only be determined in a laboratory using confirmatory methods. Increasing supportive regulations are expected to boost the growth of the drug testing market in the upcoming years. Nevertheless, Drug Hunter's market launch faces multiple challenges, that should be overcome by SafePAS. The current proposal aims to map the regulatory requirements and markets' peculiarities, fitting Drug Hunter to regulations. Our initial business model will be tested and improved, the marketing strategy will be developed, tested, and validated, and the distributors', business partners, and customers' networks will be built. We will conduct pre-clinical studies with our partners, opening new customer segments such as clinical labs. WomenTech EU will help us scale up Drug Hunter's market launch and SafePAS growth.\"",

Currently, we are only utilizing only 3% of the food resources in the ocean. Fish farming of salmon is a sustainable resource with little impact with a potential to grow five folds by 2050, but there is a problem. The parasite sea lice is killing over 50 million salmon each year in Norway alone, and the problem costs over 1 bnEUR each year. Blue Lice develops a system that prevents sea lice infestations in salmon farming in a sustainable way. By only using a light source and the scent of salmon as attractants the company has made a system of traps attracting and capturing sea lice before it can infest the salmon. This reduces the levels of sea lice at the fish farm, increasing welfare and reducing the cost by removing treatments against sea lice. Blue Lice plans to use 8 months on building our go to market strategy for commercialization. The plan will be as follows:An overall market analysis to segment our market (approx. 1 month)Make a sustainable business model that is both sustainable and profitable fundamented in ESG’s (approx. 2 month)Make an updated business plan (approx. 2 month)Make a go to market plan based on the updated data (approx. 2 month)Make a plan for how to be a female lead company through the scaling and growth of the company (approx. 1 month)Our innovation will create positive societal and environmental impact by bringing more sustainable salmon to the world’s growing populations, creating more jobs in the districts of Norway and internationally.

It is composed of four institutions from Southern Africa and one European. In this proposal, SEARCH II, eight institutions come together to strengthen and increase the capacities for the clinical trials review process in Southern Africa built from the SEARCH I project, including the issuance of relevant permits, CT oversight and clinical research pharmacovigilance and post-trial market authorisation by NRAs. However, insufficient access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable medical products in Southern Africa has imposed significant challenges on public health for decades. This, in part, is attributed to weakness or absence of technical expertise, lack of policies, guidelines and regulatory systems, a lack of competent regulatory professionals in the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRAs) and ineffective regional collaborations among the NRAs and NECs. In response to these regulatory challenges, the SEARCH I project initiated a process of regional harmonisation efforts and conducted SWOT analysis among the southern African members, and developed a comprehensive common plan for continuous improvement and overcoming gaps at the beneficiary country level and effective harmonization of regulatory and ethical review processes. The SEARCH II project aims to support the national regulatory capacity system, develop technical expertise and continue promoting the South-South and North-South collaboration built from the SEARCH I project, while also enhancing and advocating the establishment and structuring of NRAs and NECs in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia.\"",

         "\"There is a gender gap in healthcare, and women’s health suffers from lack of prioritization. Preforma AS is a deep tech company wanting to close this gap and improve women's health. Our short term objective is to introduce our product in Europe, develop our platform further, and position ourselves for scaling up with Europe as our home market. Preforma AS has a female founder, and a majority of women in management.Preforma AS is founded by Maria Ræder , a researcher and gynecologist, who over a number of years has systematized best practices and developed tools to improve gynecological examination, diagnosis and treatment. In interaction with more than 40 000 patients and healthcare personnel, we've developed a dynamic medical history collector and started conceptualizing a deep tech platform for a wider range of services.Our main challenges are: Limited international network, Market acceptance, International commercialization experience, People management, Business plan and market entry strategy and Investor relationsWe propose a work plan with a duration of 12 months, with two work packages: (1) A business work package focusing on product, market, technology and funding, and a (2) people package focusing on talent and network. The work packages will go in parallel, and will have common administrative processes. The main participants from our company are Maria Ræder (founder and CEO) and Madeleine Andresen (CTO).Even if we've come a long way already, we are certain that the Women TechEU programme will enrich our project to include activities that gives us a better insight in the European market, a better understanding of legal and customer requirements, and also of possible competitors and partners. We also need help to improve our internal competences and enhance our network.\"",

Prof. Mette Thomsen, the founder of Haloderma, has dedicated decades of her research to understand halophytes and their applications. Thanks to our state-of-the-art characterization methods, we are able to optimise our extraction process to formulate a natural herbal extract with strong potency for the skin. Our extract is designed for a rich composition of antioxidants, flavonoids and polyphenols targeted towards anti-inflammation and regeneration of the skin. Those abilities make our extract suitable for chronic skin issues such as psoriasis, eczema, urticaria. Some of the phytochemicals extracted have not been categorised in literature before, which makes our research innovative and unique. Today, Haloderma is solely focused on producing natural skincare for sensitive/damaged skin. Our prototype cream was described in a study analysing its effect against itch and pain caused by dermatitis. Current users of our cream suffered from issues of extreme dryness, psoriasis and chronic eczema. They unanimously reported relief from the first cream application and visual improvements of the skin were observed as early as 14 days after. We are ambitious in our mission to become the leading Danish phytoactive skincare business for problematic skin. Currently, more clinical studies need to be executed to fully understand the power and applications of our extract. Given the success of our cream, we plan to expand our product portfolio to a skincare line. We hereby apply to this Horizon grant to fulfil our product development steps towards high-performing natural phytoactive skincare products for sensitive skin.\"",

         "\"The traditional linear plastic industry business model results in an ever-growing amount of accumulated waste which contributes significantly to the negative environmental impact of the global plastic industry. One of the biggest issues concerning the recycling of used polymeric materials, packaging, textile, furniture, is the handling of complex waste streams consisting of mixtures, co-polymers, and other recalcitrant materials, such as thermosets (non-melting plastics, foams), that can be only burned or disposed of on the landfills. Yet, neither of these solutions is acceptable from the environmental point of view, therefore the new regulations and EU directives aim to limit these methods.We have developed a novel approach towards handling of complex plastic waste streams, where there is no available recycling alternative, thanks to under patent technologies. The approach is based on one specific insect, Galleria mellonella, the greater wax moth, and we have developed a scalable vertical farming process that enables the insects to digest and transform polymeric materials into proteins, lipids and biofertilizers. The long-term goal of this developed process is an environmentally-sound and commercially-successful transformation facility.WINSCALE focuses on the scaling up of the transformation process. Namely, it focuses on the biochemical and technological development of the solution applied to two specifically difficult waste streams: sludge coming from the waste treating companies and polyurethane foam coming from matrass recycling facilities.WINSCALE enables the overall improvement of the investor readiness of the developed solution, contributes to the creation of new, cross-sectoral value chains of waste transformation to added value products, thus promoting European competitiveness in the knowledge-based modern economy and women’s leadership in the deep tech industry.\"",

We additionally offer on client premise, licensed software. Our next challenging milestone is to scale a) by innovating the business and b) by having a critical assessment of the technology. We aim to exploit our niche market position. We are specifically aiming to be attractive to key partners that offer our together with their own services. We need scale our infrastructure and database-related technologies alongside with the business. Only both will allow us to future-proof our business paving the way for a sustainable business.   Dr. Nikola Müller will profit from being part of the Women Leadership Program by sharpening negotiation skills, learning how to improve public visibility and finally, getting into potent female-friendly investor networks. Compared to classical IT, biotech or digital health companies, our offering opens a yet unexplored niche, which is why we will enormously profit from the Women TechEU grant. The non-dilutive funding will be critical of us being able to support the scale-developments to be able to move our business forward.\"",

         "Plasmodium vivax is considered the most difficult species of human malaria parasite to eliminate because of the inability of conventional diagnostics to detect individuals who carry dormant liver forms and sustain malaria transmission. The consortium has developed the first diagnostic test that addresses this problem. PvSeroRDT aims to develop a point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to transfer the consortium‚Äôs validated lab-based test to the field to support implementation of the P. vivax Serological Test and Treatment (PvSeroTAT) malaria control strategy.      The PvSeroRDT specific objectives are: 1) Develop a POC RDT using lateral flow technology to measure antibodies to four P. vivax proteins that are biomarkers for the dormant liver-stage of P. vivax. 2) Establish Africa-based manufacturing capacity at DIATROPIX (Senegal) following RDT development at Abingdon Health, a UK-based SME specialising in lateral flow assays.3) Validate RDT performance with bio-banked samples, followed by field-based clinical validation on freshly collected samples in Ethiopia and Madagascar.4) Develop a clear regulatory strategy to streamline market authorization and access to this first-in-class P. vivax serological testing. PvSeroRDT addresses all expected outcomes and impacts of this call topic and work program, respectively. Specifically, it will contribute a robust POC diagnostic to the pipeline in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and enable the implementation of the AU-EU Innovation Agenda for public health. The project is designed to address the WHO‚Äôs preferred profile for P. vivax diagnosis, to translate an SME prototype to Africa-based industrial design, and to test clinical performance in several SSA sites, thus enhancing international cooperation in SSA and improving training opportunities in SSA. Ultimately, PvSeroRDT will facilitate implementation of PvSeroTAT ‚Äì a new intervention for malaria elimination.",

The partnership will implement a range of activities via peer-to-peer learning, including study visits and staff exchanges, to develop closer relationships within the partnership, and with the wider regional innovation ecosystems, as well as to learn improved innovation support measures.  These will be cemented via operational work to build and develop innovation ecosystems and SMEs via hackathons and challenges (160 organisations involved),  by providing direct SME support on innovation management (24 cross-border KAM cases), and helping widening country SMEs towards financing of innovation projects (50+ cases). Over 450 SMEs will be engaged with during the implementation of the project, which will include active cooperation with 20 other innovation ecosystems. BIOBoost connects 7 homogenous EU regions in terms of similarities of RIS3 and S3 Platform synergies related to bioeconomy and digitalisation. The multidisciplinary partnership has been strategically selected, to work in  an inclusive and interactive bottom-up process, to discover potential new activities, and identify new opportunities that emerge from this interaction. Despite the homogeneity in terms of regional smart specialisation, the consortium consists of partners with a wide variety of complementary skills and experience, covering a wide geographical area and with considerable economic, social and environmental differences.",

         "Chronic inflammation underlies several diseases. In Crohns disease (CD), there is mounting evidence of a preclinical phase characterized by immunological changes that precede symptoms. Here, we propose a thorough and innovative approach to better understand the health-to-chronic inflammation transition occurring in patients with CD that will be translated in improved disease prediction and prevention. We will address how changes in glycosylation of the gut mucosa act as a primary event that dysregulates not only local mechanisms (imposing maladapted host-microbiome interactions) but also systemic mechanisms (promoting anti-microbial antibodies production), involving the novel concept of glycan mimicry as an early trigger of the health to inflammation transition  GlycanTrigger. Capitalizing on our recent findings showing that changes in the expression of complex branched N-glycans at gut mucosa regulate Inflammatory Bowel Disease immunopathogenesis, we here hypothesize that changes in gut glycocalyx impose early perturbations in host-microbiome interactions, leading to the exposure of altered (glyco)neoantigens, both by pathogens and host epithelial cells which trigger the activation of innate immune response. Moreover, following our recent discovery that changes in glycosylation can be detected in serum years before CD diagnosis and are correlated with increased levels of pathogenic antimicrobial antibodies (ASCA), we will here pursue the hypothesis that changes in mucosa glycans constitute a major source for the development of anti-glycan antibodies (ASCA), associated with health-to-inflammation transition. The long-term GOAL of this proposal is to unlock, through an integrative approach, a new checkpoint that regulates the transition to chronic inflammation. Our proposal will lead to breakthrough concepts in the health to chronic inflammation transition and to novel predictive tools translated in novel glyco-intervention strategies for disease prevention.",

As part of the FPA, a call for proposals (CfP) was launched jointly with the EU and supported the preclinical development of Rift Valley Fever Virus vaccines and the late-stage development of Chikungunya virus vaccines (CHIKV). While previous funding has led to the development of pre-licensure CHIK vaccines, in this current application we like to further advance our CHIK vaccine programme, and support CHIK vaccines that are near or have achieved regulatory licensure by supporting their clinical development into phase IV clinical trials to increase our understanding of the long-term safety, durability of protection, and effectiveness against virologically confirmed disease. Furthermore, we would like to expand the use indication by supporting clinical trials in vulnerable populations, including children, immunosuppressed and pregnant women.‚ÄØAs part of this grant application, we also like to launch a CfP on Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIM). The overall objective of the CHIM proposal is to support research projects that increase knowledge in vaccine-induced mucosal immunity and advance the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against coronaviruses and other potential respiratory viral threats.‚ÄØThe expected outcome of this CfP is to create a global network of experts conducting CHIM at a high level of consistency and reliability.

The founding team consists of four members, led by CEO and Head of Hardware Sarah Nesti. With Lisa Nesti (CMO) and Henrik Burger (CFO) in the business team and Benjamin Auer (CTO) as the process engineer this diverse team is perfectly equipped to create a successful business. The founders gained prior start-up experience in a B2B e-commerce business launched in 2020 with over 30 customers and 30K Euro revenue. The entire team consists of 9 members, including two marketing experts, two business assistants and a product designer.The Oaters goal is to inspires sustainable consumption to protect and enrich life for all generations to come. We want to achieve this by downsizing the industrial production into a compact machine for local production of fresh oat milk. This doesn‚Äôt only improve taste, but also lowers costs and reduces the environmental impact. By producing the oat milk at the point of sale packaging is eliminated and transport emissions are significantly reduced due to the fact that oat milk is 90% water. The Oater‚Äôs business model is ‚ÄúOat milk as a service‚Äù meaning that B2B customers borrow the machine for free and only pay by liter for the Oater packages, which consist of the ingredients needed to produce the oat milk in the machine. This model ensures constant delivery profits and scale-up as hardware profits are negligible compared to delivery service. The Oater provides a holistic ecosystem solution, consisting of the IoT machine, frequent replenishments, and a smart online platform. The main objectives are to introduce customers into our ecosystem, simplify entry and make oat milk exciting at the POS.",

Skeletal orthodontic deformities are divided into three; Class I, Class II, and Class III. The ideal age of intervention for these three classifications is different. Class III problems should be detected at age 7, but diagnosis is difficult even for the orthodontist at this age when symptoms are not yet discernible to the human eye. Even when the cephalometric film taken with an X-ray is analyzed, it may not be noticed by people. In addition, it is not possible to have an orthodontic examination for children all around the world before the age of 7. The main tasks carried out by our application include screening for the preliminary diagnosis by identifying symptoms in the profile photo; informing the parents; directing to the doctor, and facilitating the doctor-patient interaction. For Class III, the accuracy rate of correctly classified images was found to be 81.66%. The current prototype was created using statistical data from the Turkish population, and an application that can extract various skeletal characteristics from any given data training set is currently being developed. We intend to expand to the international market and create a training model for various races once we can diagnose Class I and Class II problems with the same accuracy.",

         "Better diagnostic approaches are required to improve TB control in Africa, which is suboptimal. One neglected aspect of TB diagnosis is that of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), which comprises ~15% of the TB caseload. However, in HIV-endemic settings over one third of cases are due to EPTB (the most common manifestation being pleural TB). Frontline same day sputum-based diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert perform poorly when using fluid derived from EPTB-specific compartments (e.g. pleural fluid). Indeed, GeneXpert sensitivity in pleural TB is ~35%. ADA, the current standard of care used in clinical practice has poor specificity, especially in pericardial TB and TB-meningitis (see preliminary data). By contrast, unstimulated interferon-gamma (not T-cell-based IGRAs that require overnight stimulation) is an excellent biomarker for the diagnosis of EPTB (confirmed in 2 meta-analyses). A South African university start-up has now developed a low-cost same-day EPTB diagnostic test (IRISA-TB), which has been evaluated and published in several small clinical trials (see main proposal) and is locked-in for scale-up dissemination in 2022. The test is CE marked, SAHPRA approved,  and endorsed by the Global Fund. This proposal encompasses a large prospective multicentric study (n= 2170 patients) of IRISA-TB in various forms of EPTB (pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal TB, and TB meningitis). The proposed study (EPiTB) has excellent fidelity with the EDCTP call because it will enable ‚Äúthe registration of a new health technology through pragmatic effectiveness studies‚Äù, ‚Äúenable uptake of results into clinical practice‚Äù and facilitate WHO endorsement. Thus, EPiTB will drive the facilitation and uptake of an important new TB diagnostic test in Africa. Importantly, an African-invented and designed test will be promoted. Indeed, innovation and the development of an African knowledge-based economy is a key priority of the EDCTP.",

         "The number of studies and experiments on humans is increasing in Africa. For the past two decades, the setting up of national health research ethics committees (NREC) in Africa, encouraged by the WHO, UNESCO and CIOMS, has resulted to a need for a framework to guide and standardise how Phase II to IV clinical trials in Africa are conducted. Additionally, NREC and National Regulatory Agency (NMRA) must proactively play their roles in managing and regulating clinical trials. In C√¥te d'Ivoire, an important decree signed by the President of the Republic in April 2020 defines the regulation of clinical trials in the country. The decree positions Universities and the establishment of institutional research ethics committees (IRECs) as the third pillar for enhancing the conduct of clinical trials and other categories of health research. However, only a couple of institutional review committees exist, with a very small proportion of researchers being aware of these IRECs. Furthermore, knowledge about the existence and functions of NRA is estimated to be much lower comparative to NREC. The need for NREC, NMRA and IRECs to work in synergy is a critical prerequisite for raising the quality of clinical trials to international standards.Funded by EDCTP II, the CECABI project (CSA2020ERC-3081), was instrumental in laying the foundation for building the regulatory and ethics capacity in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Important, it identified critical gaps that need urgent attention. The proposed CECABI II is a three years project that seeks to 1) Build capacity in clinical trials, GCP and research ethics for research practitioners  2) Enhance quality assurance through ISO certification of the NREC3) Digitalise the operations and ongoing collaboration between the NREC and NRA 4) Support the domestication and digitalisation of AVAREF system5)  Monitor and evaluation to implementation of the project",

         "The main objective of this project proposal is to boost the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the novel Concept of Floating Dual Chamber Oscillating Water Column (FOWC) device. FOWC is a kind of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) system that captures energy of waves and converts it into electricity. The generated electricity is used to produce green Hydrogen from the sea water. The produced Hydrogen is stored inside the internal tanks of the device to be used as the ‚Äúclean fuel‚Äù by the next generation of ships. The idea of this system is the outcome of more than a decade of R&D activities carried out in a prestigious European University to make the WEC devices an economically viable solution to produce clean energy. This innovative solution is the ‚Äúfirst and only‚Äù WEC in the market that can act like a ‚Äúfloating fuel station‚Äù for ocean going ships to reliably produce their clean fuel demand in the middle of oceans with affordable cost. Hence, this technology could play a prominent role in the supply chain of the decarbonizing marine transportation sector that destructively produces 3% carbon emissions in the World. At the moment, this technology has the maturation level of TRL 3. It is planned to perform a further optimization process on the conceptual design of this technology under the scope of this project proposal which allows concluding TRL 3 stage of development. Complementary laboratory tests will be carried out on the optimized model and the new Intellectual property (IP) will be submitted concerning the optimized design. The other main objective of this project proposal is to enhance coordination and marketing skills as well as extending the network of the CEO & Co-Founder of the company and her team according to the unique environment, coaching programme and tailored training session opportunities provided for European Women leaders under the scope of Women TechEU Programme.",

That's why we created a personal assistant ‚Äì Elia. Elia is a tool for busy professionals or swamped students struggling with their English. It connects English learning to their daily activities, e.g. writing an email at work",
         " watching videos on YouTube",
         " or reading an article for a biology class. Because learning that is personalised and in context has been found to be the most effective form of learning. Elia started as a PhD project. Hence it's based on insights from cognitive linguistics and developed using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. We presented it at conferences in Berkeley and Cambridge. The first demo version of Elia was launched at German universities in January 2022. Currently it has over 1600 users. We are about to close partnerships with two private language school and two student organisations: ISIC France and Spain. Since January, we have been working on improving the product to reach product-market fit. We reduced the churn rate (install to uninstall) from 19%  to 4% and increased the conversion rate (website to install) from 11% to 24%. Currently, 34% of users would be very disappointed if they could no longer use Elia. We are on our way to achieving product-market fit.We need the support of this grant, both financial and mentoring, to help us 1) reach the product-market-fit, 2) help us extend our partnerships and user base, 3) buy us time to find a venture capital investor. According to the Female Startup-Up Funding Index, \"\"In Austria, 0% of startups who raised money in the first half of 2022 have all-female founding teams and women make up 7% of the 174 founders who received funding.\"\" The numbers are no different elsewhere. Help us change these numbers. We are an all-female founding team. We could boost the \"\"0%\"\" number. But we need your help.\"\"",

         "CO-INVESTIN focuses on creating cross-border co-investment opportunities for modest and moderate EU ecosystems by leveraging promising startups in the portfolio of local investors to attract foreign investors from more advanced ecosystems in their new rounds. To achieve that, the partners will pilot the approach in 4 emerging ecosystems (EL, BG, RO, PT) where the consortium partners have a strong footprint and progressively integrate at least 10 additional emerging/ moderate ecosystems by the end of the project. The project focuses on the funding gap around the Series A, very acute in these ecosystems both from the lack of capital and investors perspective, as well as in terms of deal size with respect to more advanced ecosystems. As demonstrated by the recent experience with the EIC Fund, identifying a lead investor and co-investors is a challenging task for DeepTech start-ups, in particular the ones from emerging ecosystems.The CO-INVESTIN approach relies on 4 main dimensions, that cover in a complete manner both the analytic and the action oriented dimensions of the approach: 1. Investment gap analysis, 2. Development of Market Orientation Programmes, 3. Stimulating cross-border investments and 4. Upscaling the framework and enhancing its impacts.The main project results include:‚Ä¢At least 5 working groups to foster the creation of structured and coordinated networks‚Ä¢At least 20 peer investor match-making sessions‚Ä¢Establishment of local CPI and activation of the Assistance Service for foreign investors‚Ä¢Market orientation programmes for European investors, with emphasis on women for at least 10 ecosystems‚Ä¢5 networking review sessions & VC syndication to encourage joint ventures & Cooperation with innovation agencies‚Ä¢2 International business forums & conferences to attract and connect investorsParticular focus will be placed on fostering the increased participation of women in both the entrepreneurial endeavours, as well as investment landscape.",

         "372 million women globally have a silent torturer - recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) , which affects 3 out of 4 women at some point in their lives. Despite therapeutic advances, VVC remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society and being the second largest gynaecological infection. If it is left untreated, many complications have been appointed as its consequence, such as infertility, subsequent preterm delivery, suppression of the immune system, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic abscess, menstrual disorders and miscarriage.Avodes has developed an innovative medical device for menstruation - a patented anatomically shaped ‚Äúmoist sponge‚Äù made of completely natural, biodegradable materials (biodegradable within 1 month). It protects innate defence mechanisms of vaginal microflora during most vulnerable period ‚Äì menstruation. Studies have shown, that fluctuating hormones and the resulting imbalance of vaginal flora cause an increased risk of a yeast infection every month. Unique Avodes biotechnological solution preserves women‚Äôs natural vaginal microbiota in the same time selectively inhibiting growth of pathogenic microorganisms. It reduces risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) by 85 % thus effectively preventing the disease. Avodes is the only medical product designed to prevent infection, rather than deal with the consequences. Avodes effectively disrupts the vicious cycle of ‚Äùmicrobiota disbalance ‚Äì> infection ‚Äì> antibiotic/fungicidal treatment‚Äì> microbiota disbalance‚Äù and offers break-through solution which protects women‚Äôs health and the environment.  Women Tech EU programme would support company in upgrading the business model, business and marketing plan, market validation and would help to find partners (clinical, manufacturing and commercial) as well as to prepare funding strategy. Successful project implementation will provide much needed tailwind to our company to bring the product to the market.",

         "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by the pathological process in which fat, cholesterol and calcium accumulate on the arterial wall. It is the leading cause of mortality in the world, affecting in 2019 about 200 million individuals or 2.5% of the global population and resulting in over 9 million deaths annually. The prevalence of CAD in the European Union (EU) reached 5.11% in 2019 . As a result, CAD-related deaths topped 973,000 in the EU in 2019. CAD incidence is expected to rise further due to the increased prevalence of risk factors including obesity, diabetes, and increasing age. For a patient with CAD, the care pathway still involves enormous variability and complexities. Inefficiencies and challenges in the treatment pathway are associated with poorer patient outcomes including recurrent cardiac events, incomplete revascularization in complex patients, and increased risk of mortality in patients with both acute and chronic CAD. Due to the low sensitivity or specificity of the standard diagnostic tests, 60% of CAD patients unnecessarily undergo an ICA, as they are found to have non-significant coronary stenoses and do not require revascularization.Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) uses X-ray technology and computer processing to create a detailed 3D image of the coronary arteries, revealing the degree of lumen obstruction. It provides non-invasive access to the coronary anatomy, also for asymptomatic patients who would normally not undergo invasive coronary angiography (ICA).  Current guidelines adopted in the US, EU, and the UK recommend CCTA as a first-line test for evaluation of CAD, positioning it as a \"\"gatekeeper\"\" to the Cath lab.In COMBINE-CT, we will deliver a fully automated, vendor agnostic CCTA-enabled workflow for chronic CAD patients, covering diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. COMBINE-CT will close the gaps in the existing workflow for the treatment of chronic CAD, to improve hospital efficiency and patient outcomes. AI-powered CCTA algorithms will enable definitive ischemia diagnosis, accurate patient stratification and efficient planning of the interventions, as well as patient specific follow-up. While our focus on CAD is justified by the large patient population, the CCTA-enabled diagnostic accuracy and seamless workflow, backed by the clinical evidence generated in five multicentre clinical trials, will be directly transferable to other clinical domains using CT.Interdisciplinarity is intrinsically built in the design of the COMBINE-CT consortium, combining expertise in cardiology, cardiovascular radiology, interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, pharmacology ‚Äì with expertise from engineering (medical imaging) and AI. The public-private partnership in COMBINE-CT integrates top knowledge on several medical disciplines (cardiology, radiology, interventional cardiology) with engineering, AI, design expertise - as well as the involvement of health economists and patient organizations, to fill in the gaps of the current CAD clinical pathways and prepare the ground for the imminent high-volume CCTA needs, beyond the research hospital setting.Clinical partners represent more than half of the COMBINE-CT consortium, ensuring access to large cohorts for stable CAD patients. COMBINE-CT will also lay the ground for further research that is likely to trigger a paradigm shift towards the use of imaging markers in the medical treatment evaluation and clinical trial design.\"\"",

         "Macro-economic models are widely applied across the EU to support strategic planning for R&I and the green transition. However, these models do not include a detailed representation of R&I policies and do not explicitly model green technologies and the economic sectors that develop these technologies, the performance of R&D and its role in creating first mover advantages, monopoly rents, and eventually successful deployment of the green and digital technologies. To respond to these challenges, TWINRD aims to develop new data, technology matrices, models and enhance leading existing macro-economic modelling (GEM-E3 and NEMESIS). To this end TWINRD will develop innovative and interdisciplinary approaches for the enhanced modelling representation of R&I and innovation policy in EU-27 and improve the integration of R&I activities in applied macro-economic models based also on the collection, empirical analysis and integration of new data and technology matrices for green and digital technologies into the macro-models. TWINRD will develop a new innovative, open-source model specifically designed to address the Twin transition that goes beyond the standard approaches and will be both supply and demand driven. The advanced modelling tools will be used for the evaluation and assessment of R&I policy impacts on socio-economic and environmental indicators aiming to distil policy-relevant insights. All datasets, models and sets of software will be made freely accessible to stakeholders and the public in the TWINRD online platform and in other channels. The entire project will be based on active stakeholder interactions and inclusive dialogue to co-design the research and scenarios explored based on the creation of TWINRD open forum.",

For that we have 4 Objectives: 1) To upgrade the commercialization strategy of our company; 2) To conduct the clinical assessment of our first product, antibacterial wound dressing; 3) To establish the quality management system (QMS) in our company and 4) To train participants. The main project results will be the improved commercialization strategy (including new contacts with the stakeholders), collaboration with the EU key opinion leaders and established QMS that will greatly increase the connectivity and competitiveness of our women-led deep-tech startup within innovation ecosystems of the EU. This will lead to more inclusive and gender equal innovation ecosystem in EU, since Estonia is one of the EU inclusiveness target countries and has one of the EU's highest inequalities between the salaries and top positions of women and men according to Eurostat. Not least, NEXTNANO will result in significant impacts: environmental (decreased use of antibiotics), societal (20% less amputations) and economical (10 mln eur revenue by 2026 and new high value-added jobs for 15 persons such as scientists, medical doctors, engineers and sales managers).",

         "600m people globally suffer from autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis. The symptoms can be severe, causing intense pain and suffering for patients. The cost of RA alone for Europe is ‚Ç¨45.3 billion p.a.A growing need: Unlike diabetes patients for example who can measure their own blood sugar levels, there is currently no method to measure disease activity quickly and accurately for autoimmune patients, non-invasively at home. Furthermore, most autoimmune diseases have unpredictable flares in disease activity despite stable medication, and the causes of such flares differ between patients and are largely unidentifiable.Our deep-tech innovation is an Artificial Intelligence approach to the Monitoring of Autoimmune Diseases at Home with a Novel Biomarker Algorithm:  Through 15 years of research in this field, the founder of Kaass Discovery, Dr Anita Kaass, has shown a key biomarker, Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), is common to several autoimmune diseases. It has been scientifically shown that GnRH levels increase with increasing disease activity. Kaass Discovery is developing a highly novel, deep tech solution to allow autoimmune disease patients to self-manage their conditions and minimize or even eliminate the symptoms of autoimmune diseases. The solution, which we call ‚Äòa-Doc‚Äô, uses a saliva sample to indicate disease activity and provide an accurate, instantaneous value. In line with this need, it is also low cost, accurate and simple to use ensuring it is suitable for home use. The data collected from the device will be sent to the Kaass Discovery Cloud for improving the predictive analytical models, and giving an individualised meaningful result to the user on their mobile deviceThe aims of the Women TechEU programme align perfectly with the needs of Kaass Discovery.  The business coaching support provided will ensure we are prepared and able to successfully commercialise this exciting technology.",

Direct air capture (DAC) technology is suitable for offsetting previously over-looked emissions. One cannot overestimate the potential impact of a functional CO2 DAC technology ‚Äì not only can it help solve environmental problems, but DAC technology can also empower the industry to utilize the captured CO2. The industrial conversion of CO2 into value-added products will cause a slow but steady switch from fossil fuels, turning CO2 from our worst enemy to our best friend. Within the frames of this project, RedoxNRG will develop new electrosorbent materials for the direct air electrocapture of CO2. To advance DAC technology, we suggest augmenting electrocapture with a new class of redox-active and electrically conductive metal-organic materials (ecoMOMs).",

         "\"CONNECTINGHEALTH - CONNECTing the dots withIN diGItal HEALTH Innovation Ecosystems\"\" is a two-year preparatory action for setting up joint programme among the actors of the digital health ecosystems in Europe and beyond. The overall aim of the project is fully aligned with the call for proposals, which is to foster interconnected, inclusive innovation ecosystems across Europe and maximising the value of innovation in one of the sectors that provides the future opportunities for growth and increased competitiveness and innovativeness, namely the digital health. CONNECTINGHEALTH will be implemented by the small and agile core group, which consists of the European Connected Health Alliance as a European partner and three organisations that are leaders of the digital health ecosystems in their regions: Scotland, Western Hungary and Southern Ostrobothnia. To reach its goals, CONNECTINGHEALTH will conduct the mapping of the digital health ecosystems in Europe, their initiatives, projects, resources and stakeholders, develop the future scenario for the digital health sector in Europe 2030 and identify the preferable future that will be the base for the multi-year action plan, co-designed together with the stakeholders and ecosystems engaged in the project through the futures and investigative workshops. Besides the investigation on the general level of the digital health, the project will look deeper into the three topic crucial for the further development of the digital health sector in Europe, namely: 1/ health for wealth opportunities, 2/ opportunities of the transition from traditional to digital health industry and 3/ opportunities of engaging the stakeholders from health and social sector in the development and implementation of the solutions. CONNECTINGHEALTH will result with the multi-year action plan and the number of immediately exploitable results, eg. the future scenarios and the focus area papers. They will be disseminated widely to the key stakeholders.\"\"",

         "The proposed project consists in commercialisation of a biotechnology based on methanotrophic bacteria allowing for turning waste methane into high grade, ecological products. The general objectives of the proposed work are: support for the commercialisation of long-term research by prof. Zofia Stƒôpniewska over methanotrophic bacteria, validation of technology and business model, company organisation and preparation of its financing path. Certain cultures of methanotrophic bacteria were examined as part of research conducted at the Department of Biochemistry and Environmental Chemistry of the Catholic University of Lublin. They can absorb methane produced, among others, in coal, lignite, copper and other minerals mines, in the transport of natural gas, as well as in animal husbandry, in landfills, in industrial processes and elsewhere. This will reduce the risks associated with the explosion of methane and reduce its emissions to the atmosphere, and therefore lower the climatic load, because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greenhouse coefficient approximately 25 times higher than CO2 in 25 years. The project is thus consistent with the EU Methane Strategy, which envisages a series of measures to reduce methane emissions. The use of biofilters based on methanotrophic bacteria would reduce the negative impact of methane emissions to the environment, and would also allow to obtain valuable raw materials obtained from the produced bacterial biomass, e.g. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) - a biodegradable plastic, ectoine or carbohydrates for the production of animal feed.The essence of the product is the proper selection of BM bacteria cultures and determination of the optimal environment and parameters of their life. It was the subject of many scientific works conducted by the founder, Microbic Sp. z o.o. - prof. Zofia Stƒôpniewska - during the last 20 years. These bacteria are ready for multiplication and colonisation of biofilters.",

In Cogo you can find more than 250 mobility operators of shared bikes, scooters, cars and mopeds and can be used in more than 700 cities worldwide. I founded Cogo back in March 2020 during the pandemic, with two old colleagues from the management group of momondo, later KAYAK part of Booking Holdings. We founded Cogo with a mission to move people away from short private car trips and on to shared mobility, to help create more sustainable cities. My driver for starting Cogo is that traffic in our cities and the derived CO2 emissions are one of the biggest challenges we need to solve in our lifetime. The industry of shared mobility has come to a stage where the complexity and fragmentation is ready for an aggregator level to reach the full potential shared mobility can offer. To create a successful aggregator that has the perfect combination of best user content, product users love and the right business model is my niche expertise. During this programme we launch and roll-out Cogo full-service platform where users can start, stop, pay and manage all trips across multiple shared mobility operators within the Cogo app. Cogo is currently pre-revenue and will with the launch of the full-service platform start to generate revenue. This project will set-up and execute on a clear strategic and technical roll-out playbook from launch in our home market to roll-out throughout Europe. We will set-up and establish the technical platform to scale quickly yet controlled with Cogo Console for multi-partner operational control including a well-thought through complex revenue management system and strategy to maximise shared mobility utilisation while building a solid revenue foundation.

         "A SAFE, a Simple Agreement for Future Equity is a financial instrument which has been developed by Y Combinator, one visible accelerator in the US more than 10 years ago. Currently, in the US and in Canada more than 80 % of the investments in startups are realized as SAFE investments. In Europe, this financial instrument is not as widely diffused. The reasons for developing the SAFEs lie among others in a higher transaction speed and a lower level of bureaucracy in all periods of the investment lifecycle. Both mentioned reasons might also toughen up the European financial ecosystem. Since such an instrument can not be transferred in a ‚Äúblind copy mode‚Äù into another cultural ecosystem with different policies and mentalities, the objective of DEEPSAFE is to design, validate , disseminate and finally establish an Europeanized instantiation of core SAFE building and deliver it into the European startup ecosystem (40 startups from emerging/moderate regions negotiating SAFE agreements with investors/corporates).

In parallel, it allows clinics to: increase their caseload; personalize speech therapy plans; and maximise patient compliance by allowing them to practice speech therapy on our mobile app. This will contribute to a significant reduction in PD treatment costs for the healthcare systems and wait lists.PD Patients download a mobile app which delivers their care programme, analyses their voice, and tracks their progress for their therapist. Patients are guided through their practice with exercises, i.e. volume exercises, high and low pitch exercises, and practicing key every day phrases. Planned improvements to our Software as a Service will include the use of machine learning algorithms supporting enhanced voice analysis and progress monitoring, and the implementation of decision making and recommendation capabilities for therapists.",

         "BUSINESS NEED. Climate change leads to infrastructure disruption, food insecurity and global losses and hence, does directly affect safety and security of people. Nowadays, when an event occurs emergency protocols are activated, and damages are evaluated in the following days. There is a need of having vulnerability assessment information, before the event occurs to know where the most vulnerable area, asset or population is. Knowing the most vulnerable point and its dynamic evolution (where the impact will be worst) is a key information to generate an adaptative answer to climate extreme events and minimize socio economic damages.However, current impact analysis methods are semi-automated, limiting the speed, coverage and number of analyses that can be done. Our solution, interoperable, fast to deploy and easy to use, is based in the analysis of different data sources such as Copernicus (Satellite data), Meteo patterns and OpenData.MARKET OPPORTUNITY. During the last decade thousands of satellites have been put in orbit creating the new space economy. The total amount of investment done just in Copernicus Satellites amounts to 8,2 Billion. In addition, according to Space Capital  the total equity investment over the last decade in the space economy was ‚Ç¨177.7 billion. However, the penetration over different industrial markets is very low , putting at risk the Return of Investment (ROI).EARTHPULSE GOAL. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the transformational technique of our era. Satellite data, and in particular, Earth Observation (EO), will greatly benefit, as other areas, from its application by lowering the cost of adoption and accelerating market uptake. Our company goal is to accelerate the market uptake of EO data with AI.At EarthPulse we are working hard on overcoming these barriers with the objective to leverage the full potential of AI4EO to make satellite analytics accessible to anyone (experts and non-expert users) through our Software SPAI.",

Robots that move in fleets work with maximum efficiency at minimum route length thanks to algorithms based on artificial intelligence. The most important technologies used are SLAM (simultaneous positioning and mapping) and FMS (fleet management system). The SLAM process uses a complex set of calculations, algorithms, and sensor inputs to navigate a previously unknown environment or to revise the map of a previously known environment and find a location. Fleet Management System (FMS) is applied to manage and control more than one robot working within the units. FMS provides complete, centralized and decentralized management of the robot fleet, allowing users to manage different mobile robotic systems from a variety of devices via standard communication protocols. In FMS, robots share route and location information with each other. In the light of this information, our algorithms determine the routes in which the robots will perform their tasks without colliding, according to our traffic rule sets.",

We do real-time detection of fake profiles and unwanted behavior, such as cyber grooming, toxicity, harassment and bullying in games and social media. Our machine learning powered moderation service will make moderation easier for our customers. We risk score all ongoing conversations real-time on gaming and social media platforms, and help our customers to prevent unwanted behavior before it makes any harm. We help them stop cyber grooming early and our initial results show we can detect grooming coversations in less than 20 messages .Our service is powering our customers with increased community health and more efficient moderation through proactive and continuous risk scoring. They can save huge amounts of human hours by using our solution. Our unique SaaS multimodal approach, combined with machine learning makes for a new era in chatroom moderation.With a novel approach based on award-winning research, researchers and data scientists at Aiba and NTNU, have developed and trained machine learning models with text and keystroke dynamics to detect cyber grooming and other unwanted behavior early so they can stop conversations to minimize harm and toxicity on their platforms. The solution has been trained and tested on short texts typically sent in a chat. From this minimal amount of information, the system has accurately been able to profile the chatter and determine both their age group and gender. The solution has been further developed to perform a continuous real-time analysis of the text messages, to mark suspicious conversations. To do this, natural language processing features (turning text into numerical feature vectors) are used, in combination with machine learning techniques.",

         "Speech and language development is one of the most critical developmental phases in early childhood. Children with poor vocabulary skills at age 5 were four times more likely to have reading difficulties, three times as likely to have mental health problems, and twice as likely to be unemployed when they reached adulthood. Yet it‚Äôs one of the most overlooked industries in terms of innovation, the way speech and language development is managed by parents, teachers and healthcare providers has not changed in DECADES.There is an over-reliance on the clinical speech and language therapists as the only means to get an assessment of a child‚Äôs speech and language skills. The result of this is children sitting on waiting lists or having early signs of delays missed, all resulting in missing out on reaching critical speech and language developmental milestones.We are developing SHARE, a radical, data driven and digitally-delivered solution to address the problems in understanding children‚Äôs speech and language development. Delivering accurate, in-home assessment of speech skills is the key to disrupting this industry, empowering the other stakeholders in this story to understand when a child‚Äôs speech skills are on track and when they are not. Our goal is to reduce the over reliance on costly face to face therapy by developing solutions that don‚Äôt just replicate existing practice but are developed around data and evidence and reflect the abilities and lifestyles of families. This is a relatively new market segment that crosses several markets and stakeholders across Speech therapy, Digital Health and the emerging New Mom Economy. We will use Women TechEU support to liaise with these stakeholders, develop commercial relations with them and build a regulatory compliance strategy for SHARE. All of these will be leveraged to get contact with and secure the investment needed to complete SHARE development and bring it to the market.",

It is highly relevant to implement these in our strategic planning and development from an early stage to assess our market opportunity at a fast pace. Secondary objectives are preparing our business for expansion through insight into public procurement and employment.Up until today we have gained information on the market situation for VR training in Norway, and characteristics that are important to take into consideration in our country. However, we are focusing on developing VR-training on international standardized procedures, confirming a great potential for our solution outside of the country. In order to succeed, we need to dedicate resources to execute an analysis of the international market. In particular, we need to conduct a competitor landscape analysis in the field. This includes addressing suppliers of medical training in VR and suppliers of e-learning for procedural training. Additionally, we need to address which markets will be our primary objectives for future expansion. These will be addressed by conducting a target market analysis and industry overview. We thereafter need to get insight and knowledge on the purchase process for our primary objectives, besides building the foundation for our employment.Women TechEU can help our business growth strategy both through mentorship and financing. We would benefit from having a mentor with experience from working with business in a fast-paced growth environment. Furthermore, we would benefit if the mentor had worked with MedTech and/or internationalization. It would be valuable for us to have a mentor that could play an active role in helping us improve our starting point related to facing the demanding and time-consuming purchase process. Included in this, is having mentorship to help us evaluate and strengthen our foundation for building a high-performance team.",

         "Patients and society expect that technical and scientific advances can provide novel improved answers to address unmet medical needs. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the 2nd most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world, with profound economic and social impacts. The absence of preventive therapies to tackle PD, requires the development of new therapeutic strategies. For Pharma companies, aiming to develop molecules for Parkinson Disease (PD) and other neurologic disorders, Fastprinciple is developing a new drug candidate, to be used as a future therapy to slow-down PD progression. Unlike alternative solutions (such as the ones commercialized by Bial, Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Abbvie, Lilly, and others), which target the symptoms, we expect to slow down the disease progression, increasing current therapies‚Äô effectiveness overtime. PD affects more than 10 million people globally and has an enormous social and economic burden.  Current treatments manage the symptoms of the disease but do not offer the patients the possibility of a cure. Unfortunately, as the disease progress to higher debilitating stage, the patient stops responding to the current symptomatic therapies, ending without therapeutic options. We have identified a molecule that with the company‚Äôs patented reformulation technology will improve the drug efficacy and slowdown the disease progression of the disease.  The current proposal aims to establish FastPrinciple‚Äôs Strategic monetization plan, by securing IP strategy and to ameliorate our business and exploitation plan.",

         "Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), the administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP+AQ), during the peak period of malaria risk has proved to be a highly effective malaria control measure in areas where transmission of malaria is highly seasonal; SMC was administered to 45 million children in 2021. Still, malaria remains the main cause of hospital admissions among young children in many parts of the Sahel and sub-Sahel and additional control measures are needed to protect children.  The malaria vaccines RTS,S/AS01E, and R21/Matrix, provide a high level of protection during the first few months after a primary series of vaccination, or after a booster dose, but efficacy wanes progressively during the following months and years. Thus, in areas with seasonal malaria transmission, one potential use for these vaccines, which provide a high but relatively short period of protection, is administration of an annual booster dose given prior to the malaria transmission season in children who have received three priming doses of the vaccine in the first year of life. However, there is a debate about the best approach to delivery of the booster doses and the main objectives of this study are to determine whether annual booster doses of RTSS,AS01E vaccine administered pre-transmission season through a mass campaign will achieve better coverage and higher impact on the incidence of malaria than pre-transmission booster doses delivered by an EPI programme at vaccination centres. This will be a pragmatic implementation study involving two cohorts of children. Two districts that have comparable malaria epidemiology, social structure, coverage of EPI vaccines, and access to treatment will be identified in both Mali and in Guinea from the list of districts that are selected for roll out of RTS,S/ASO1E vaccine by the Ministry of Health. This project will provide important information on the optimum delivery which could save many lives.",

Using a state-of-the-art combination of nanotechnology, light, and data analysis, we are at the forefront of studying single biological nanoobjects that are fundamental in life science segments such as drug discovery and development. Our patent-pending innovation, Nanofluidic Scattering Microscopy (NSM), enables a unique ability to visualize and analyze biomolecules in their native and natural state, without making any modifications to them to improve the efficiency and precision of future drugs. The core of our NSM solution is to use nanochannels in our fluidic chips as tiny optical sensors.The objectives of this proposal are to evaluate and develop our (i) production process, (ii) business model, and (iii) IP protection related to our nanofluidic NSM chips and to define the best business track and strategy for the company. This is accomplished by evaluating three options for nanofabricating the chips, establishing a maximum volume in-house production process, conducting a market analysis to understand stakeholders, conducting a patent search, and an FTO analysis related to the design and/or the function of the chips. Our goal is to commercialize NSM for a global audience, which requires long and expensive R&D processes with technical expertise. This project will therefore provide the resources and support for the next essential step in our innovation development, to significantly strengthen our position towards investors and to prepare the first round of investments to further develop and grow the company.",

The innovative and unique technology developed tackles one the current major challenges in healthcare, the rapidly increasing burden of brain diseases. With the increase of life expectancy and aging population neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The greatest unmet needs are better, faster and more cost-effective diagnostic and monitoring tools that could be widely available and have the potential to detect these diseases at the earliest stage in order to delay disability and provide each patient with a personalized treatment.To address this the team of Nocturne identified two major opportunities, the use of the retina as a window to the brain, and an already established on the market hardware imaging technology, cost-effective, widely available with no burden for the patient that can capture retinal images in less than 5 minutes.With its product, Nocturne addresses customers in pharmaceutical research, academia, and clinical care. In Germany alone, more than 1 million patients suffer from relevant diseases like Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and others. We estimate the annual market volume in Germany alone at 350 million‚Ç¨, in Europe at 2 billion‚Ç¨. At market entry, Nocturne product is a CE-certified local installable web service, which accepts data from standard retinal imaging devices. The data are then analyzed with Nocturne‚Äôs technology, and a report is generated for the physician. The pricing is based on a pay-per-analysis, a model commonly used, for example, in radiology.Our focus is by removing the technical barriers and by providing unique insights into the diseases to enable better disease management and patient care.",

         "Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)  is the most common infectious disease seen in humans. Also, UTI ranks as the Number 1 infection that leads to a prescription of antibiotics. Just in 2019, 404,6 million different UTI cases emerged worldwide that costed tens of billions of euros to economies and caused around 236.000 deaths. Luckily, UTIs can be cured effectively with right treatment. The problems need to be resolved  are: diagnosing of UTI takes a long time (2-7 days), requires expertise and is costly;  high false positive rates and contamination risk causes unnecessary laboratory costs and workload; empirical treatment given without waiting for long culture results leads to unnecessary and/or wrong antibiotic usage and consequently to antibiotic resistance.As Nanomed Diagnostic, we developed an immunoassay-based point of care test kit for rapid, inexpensive and effortless detection of UTIs (RAPID UTI). It can diagnose UTI just in 5 minutes. It provides at least 10 times less cost for diagnosis by eliminating several technical processes and costly equipment and consumable investments. It eliminates all unnecessary laboratory costs and workload caused by false-positives and contaminated samples. It prevents unnecessary or wrong antibiotic usage and the bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics.Within the scope of the 12-month planned project, meetings will be held with European potential customers and distributors, samples will be sent, improvements will be made according to the feedback received, certification studies will be completed, product promotion will be made by participating in fairs, exhibitions and conferences, printed and digital marketing materials will be prepared, and a clinical trial will be conducted in an EU origin institution.",

We want to bring our new solution, Drug Hunter, to the drug testing market. Drug Hunter is a portable drug analyzer that measures quantities of illegal drugs in oral fluid, even in multidrug use cases. It can be used onsite by law enforcement agencies, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and workplaces. Our core technologies are capillary electrophoresis, widely recognized as a golden standard for DNA analysis, and ultrasensitive deep UV fluorescence, facilitated by AI-based expert systems. Therefore, Drug Hunter provides lab-grade accuracy for simultaneous identification and quantification of illegal drugs in oral fluid, indicating the recent drug use as well as the severity of possible drug intoxication. There are currently no reliable drug testing solutions on the market (only mainstream immunoassay tests) for onsite use, and none of them can measure the quantities of drugs in the sample. So far, the strength of drug intoxication can only be determined in a laboratory using confirmatory methods. Increasing supportive regulations are expected to boost the growth of the drug testing market in the upcoming years. Nevertheless, Drug Hunter's market launch faces multiple challenges, that should be overcome by SafePAS. The current proposal aims to map the regulatory requirements and markets' peculiarities, fitting Drug Hunter to regulations. Our initial business model will be tested and improved, the marketing strategy will be developed, tested, and validated, and the distributors', business partners, and customers' networks will be built. We will conduct pre-clinical studies with our partners, opening new customer segments such as clinical labs. WomenTech EU will help us scale up Drug Hunter's market launch and SafePAS growth.",

         "In the EU, phosphorus (P) is listed as a critical raw material. It is essential for life and there is no known substitute. P is a vital constituent in fertilisers; the EU's agricultural need is 3.9 Mt/yr. We import 90% of what we consume, and 90% of what we use is irreversibly lost. The SusPhos solution upcycles P-rich waste like Sewage Sludge Ash (SSA) or struvite into phosphates, iron & magnesium salts, and silica mixtures. Our high-quality, pathogen-free compounds are suitable for formulating fertilisers and phosphate-based flame retardants (FR). Reaction by-products are fine-chemicals in their own right, making our technology a near-zero waste process. Currently, there is no technology except ours that can upcycle SSA for direct use by FR or fertiliser manufacturers. Competing solutions for P recycling are cost-prohibitive. They all use water as a solvent, which means high energy requirements for solvent evaporation. Our patented solution uses merely waste heat, which allows us to price our phosphates on the same level as if they were derived from mined phosphate rock.We will create an independent EU supply of recycled P, reducing the EU‚Äôs dependence on supply and price volatility. By 2026, we project revenues of ‚Ç¨33m and a >20% displacement of conventionally produced phosphates. Our circular P will eliminate CO2 from rock phosphate transport and reduce pollution caused by mining. Our ‚Äúurban mines‚Äù (SusPhos plants) will create hundreds of jobs across the EU, and at SusPhos, we are striving to strengthen female leadership and inspire women to choose to conduct their higher education and build carriers in chemical engineering and raw materials (currently very male-dominated sectors). With the support of Women TechEU, we aim to upgrade our rollout plan and sharpen our business development skills so that we can grow large enough to become a leading technology provider for circular P, and to become and influential player in deep-tech innovation ecosystem.",
